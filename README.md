# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains a project on sentiment analysis for movie reviews. The project was created by Udacity as part of the machine learning nanodegree. This repository entails the completed project and successful implementation of a machine learning model accessed via a web application.

The train.py file contains the code for the model, and the predict.py file contains the code to utilize the model to print an output. The main notebook utilizes both of these files to successfully implement the machine learning model to perform sentiment analyisis on a movie review.

The model was implemented using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and used Lamda, an API gateway, a jupyter notebook, S3 storage, and an HTML web page to implement the movie review sentiment analysis.

To view the implementation of the web app, download the mp4 file on this repository entitled "Sentiment Analysis Web App".
